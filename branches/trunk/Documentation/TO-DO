Completed Items

1.     Inform the kernel of the key.
2.     Add colors to the kernel widgets. On Windows platforms,
       the kernel path must represent a readable program. On other platforms,
       the path must represent an executable program.
3.     If the passphrase is not set, disable all other tabs. Also
       disable the kernel and listeners group boxes.
4.     Sticky needs a tooltip describing the feature.
5.     Add a check box to hide all disconnected neighbors. This was
       completed, however, it was removed on 06/03/2013. The option
       may cause confusion when a new neighbor is defined if a uniqueness
       error arises. Similar confusion may arise for listeners.
6.     Improve the IP input masks. Removed the underscores so that the
       space bar may be used. Attached returnPressed() signals to
       listener and neighbor IP widgets.
7.     When the RSA key generation is finished, a confirmation should
       be displayed.
8.     The context menu to share the public key should be a button.
9.     Add an icon to a connected neighbor.
10.    libspoton.dll needs to be installed in the executable's path.
11.    Add presence information to the Participants table.
12.    Provide a means of sending a message to friends only.
13.    Add UUIDs to neighbors.
14.    Display additional information pertaining to network information in
       the Neighbors table.
15.    Re-encode various databases whenever the passphrase is changed.
16.    Offline e-mail.
17.    Qt 4.6.3 support. Please ignore. Qt 4.6.x and older are not
       supported.
18.    Use QSslSockets.
19.    Inspect toInt() results.
20.    Encrypt the uuid field in the neighbors.db database.
21.    Encrypt-then-MAC.
       (http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/papers/oem.html)
22.    Some messages are echoed. The transfer method (get, post) of the
       original message should be respected.
23.    Inspect spoton_crypt's hash failures.
24.    Secure connections between the interfaces and the kernel.
25.    Dedicated lines. Such lines, if enabled by both parties, do
       not allow echoed data.
26.    The re-encoding phase may produce errors. Delete corrupt entries.
27.    All database names should be unique.
28.    Depict listeners that support SSL.
29.    Echo mode for listeners.
30.    Reset keep-alive timers if valid data has been processed.
31.    The kernel should behave as a pass-through device if
       participants are not defined. However, it should emit
       scrambled messages if necessary.
32.    Improve kernel congestion cache.
33.    Complete max. Neighbors fields.
34.    Do not destroy the children of an inactive listener. Provide a context
       menu action instead.
35.    Do not store SSL keys in listeners.db and neighbors.db.
36.    The number of connections in the Listeners table may be incorrect.
37.    Full/half-echo listeners context menu option. Children neighbors
       remain as configured.
38.    TTLs may be used to describe Spot-On graphs. Alternative?
39.    A Spot-On node may create a non-specific message having a high TTL
       with the scope of exploring graphs. The insight would be broken
       by nodes having congestion controls. TTLs need to be reviewed.
40.    Review SQL update statements.
41.    Function to separate children from listeners.
42.    Limit sending of information to the kernel. See
       spoton::slotKernelSocketState().
43.    Simplify messages. Hide header information.
44.    Local and long distance calling feature to limit PKI.
45.    Add optional signatures for inbound and outbound traffic.
46.    Bulk key copies, per the friendly Mr. Smith.
47.    Provide IP blocking capabilities.
48.    Include external IP addresses in listener certificates.
49.    Review process signals for the kernel.
50.    E-mail retrieval may fail if a node is disconnected because of
       a lifetime expiration. Other communications may fail too.
51.    Permanent certificates.
52.    Statistics.
53.    Introduce DSA and ElGamal.
54.    SQL injection.
55.    Record sent data as it may be returned via an echo.
56.    Correct implementation of the Encrypt-then-MAC usage. One key
       should be used for encryption and a separate key for generating
       the MAC.
57.    Favorite channels.
58.    Remove UTF-8 conversions in spoton_crypt::saltedPassphraseHash().
59.    Use separate hash keys with geminis.
60.    Inspect UTF-8 uses.
61.    Rewind support for transmitted mosaics.
62.    Integer overflows!
63.    Create a Tools menu. Provide mechanisms for decrypting and encrypting
       data that's been transmitted via non-Spot. That is, a feature
       to copy encrypted content and send it via other applications.
64.    Separate keys should be used for storing keyed hashes.
65.    Prevent replay attacks of authenticated sessions.
66.    Artificial impersonators.
67.    Add url logic to spoton::addFriendsKey().
68.    Provide a means of exporting and importing keys.
69.    Inbound data should be time-tagged. Nodes must purge
       containers of old data. Otherwise, one could be inundated with
       seemingly-qualified data. Nasty!
70.    SCTP.
71.    Feature to discover missing pulses.
72.    Store MACs of encrypted data along with the encrypted data.
73.    There may be an issue with the validity of stored e-mail. That is,
       retrieving e-mail from another node may retrieve compromised content.
       Inspect it!
74.    Encrypt public keys of other participants.
75.    Semi-anonymous post office boxes. Please see Institutions.
76.    Message of the day (motd).
77.    Store the id field in idiotes.db in a secure manner.
78.    Encrypt participants public keys. Keyed hashes using the public
       key as the key? Slow retrieval.
79.    Echo star systems.
80.    Adaptive Echo. See also Echo Star Systems. Configured Spot nodes
       will direct traffic based on secret tokens.
81.    Limit client connections by IP address.
82.    Purge items from post_office if their dates are invalid.
83.    Perform calling over geminis.
84.    Accounts and allowed IP addresses suffer selection issues.
85.    NTRU support.
86.    Support ECC, or not. Signatures supported.
87.    IMAP and POP3.
88.    Optional OTR because it's so pretty. Partial SMP.
89.    Provide GCM mode. libgcrypt 1.6.x is required. Authentication data
       is not included.
90.    Use super-secure memory? Used here and there.
91.    Include licenses of other software where applicable.
       Satisfy the license soldiers.
91.    Provide a total silent mode.
92.    Entering geminis is difficult.
93.    Notify user of potential replays.
94.    Prioritize keep-alive messages. Not required.
95.    Novas should have separate hash keys.
96     Do something about whitespace. There are many input paths that
       ought to be considered.
97.    E-mail institutions require dispatcher signatures.
98.    GoldBug keys should have separate hash keys.
99.    The kernel is susceptible to flooding as the newline character
       is mandatory.
100.   macdeployqt and Qt 5 do not produce correct bundles on OS X.
101.   Allow programs such as netcat to feed data to Spot-On. Specific
       private listeners would be capable of transforming the data
       into StarBeam pulses.
102.   Allow pass-through flow of non-Spot-On data.
103.   Customize expiration timers.
104.   Display information pertaining to unsigned documents.
105.   Signal handlers and safe functions. Some Windows-specific
       functions remain.
106.   Is it possible for automatic digests to be computed on StarBeams before
       the files are completed? Disable buffering and issue fsync() on
       Unix systems.
107.   Multiple Poptastic attachments.
108.   The method spoton_neighbor::savePublicKey() does not compare
       personal keys with provided keys.
109.   UDP multicast servers are not necessary.
110.   Prevent inserts of own keys in friends_public_keys.db.
111.   Keys are re-used in directory-mode file encryption. Single-pulse
       key derivation.
112.   PostgreSQL query cancellation in the kernel.
       (SET SESSION statement_timeout TO milliseconds)
113.   Active-kernel reminder warning persists.
114.   Doxygen.
115.   Include timestamps in Buzz.
116.   Include timestamps in StarBeam pulses.
117.   Include timestamps in EPKS.
118.   Include timestamps in URL bundles.
119.   Verify that the Super Echo precedes computations.
120.   spoton_misc::importUrl() and lastInsertId() over the sequence.
       Delete previous values on successful retrieval of sequence.
121.   Smoke's Fire requires CTS. Modify Buzz.
122.   Buzz Cryptographic Discovery.

Ignored Items

1.     The kernel should fetch a node's external IP address. Not ideal for
       listeners that are connected on interfaces having different external
       addresses.
2.     CGI for listeners.
3.     Hybrid group communications based on deterministic key pairs.
4.     Introduce spoton_misc::findOptimalKeyLengthForPublicKey(). The method
       will allow Spot-On to select optimal lengths for digest keys based
       on provided content and public keys. Version 0.06 introduced
       digest keys that are restricted to 32 bytes.
5.     Auto-clear textedit widgets that contain too much data.
6.     Monitor kernel health from the UI. See
       spoton::slotGeneralTimerTimeout().
7.     Participant count may be possible based on asymmetric ciphertexts.
       Research?
8.     Create a commanding language. The language could be used to
       navigate private Spot-On nodes remotely.
9.     Zero-knowledge passphrase authentication.
10.    Add SRP for account verification. What is this, the NSA?
11.    Allow user to bookmark search results. Also allow searching of
       bookmarked entries. Perhaps provide a means of searching the
       global databases as well as bookmarked entries.
12.    Allow for other ciphers besides AES for e-mail.
13.    Introduce load balancing of echoes. We're not interested in real-time
       responses. Congestion control is helpful, however, short graphs
       tend to be skewed.
14.    Per request, provide an automatic StarBeam rewind mechanism with a
       timer. Private and public libraries.
15.    Account credentials should not be recorded via reversible encryption.
       Derive keys? I really like the two-step mutual authentication.
16.    Enable SQLite foreign key support via PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON.
17.    Database entries containing hashes can be maliciously twisted. Encrypt?
18.    Artificial trust. All participants must play nicely. Zero-knowledge?
19.    Scramblers are too periodic.
20.    Hard kernel termination. Control session separation.
21.    Colorful HTTP headers. Custom protocol messages for rapid redeployment.
22.    Remote kernel termination.
23.    An interface for custom functions. Such an interface could be used
       to transform YouTube data into MP3s.
24.    What to do about corrupt database values?
25.    Implement a Qt class in support of DTLS.
26.    Limit the number of entries that are allowed to be inserted into
       a database.
27.    The data stored in shared.db is not authenticated. Uniqueness
       is not properly defined.
28.    Android build.
29.    QFSFileEngine::open: No file name specified: created from
       e-mail. Missing images?
30.    Counting users is possible. Gathering message attributes is
       also possible. See group information in MESSAGES.
31.    Add support for crypto++.
32.    1-N SCTP support.
33.    Add log filters.
34.    Lots of kernel activity may cause libgcrypt fatigue.
35.    There is some redundant deciphering of data: findMessageType()
       followed by process() routines.
36.    Move the kernel off of the local machine. Review all Common and
       GUI source for local database access. libspoton may require
       changes with respect to kernel presence. Or, create an access library.
       Or, PostgreSQL!
37.    The timers that support gathering of external IP addresses burden
       kernel objects with unnecessary work. If the machine's external IP
       address changes while connections are already established, the
       state timers will eventually cause objects to be reset and therefore
       new attempts will be made to capture the external IP addresses. Review!
38.    Index the PostgreSQL tables.
39.    Wormholes for streamed data.
40.    Sieve machine for better congestion control and less repetitive
       work.
41.    User configuration files are not encrypted.
42.    Artificial pauses. Suppose an inbound packet requires t0 time to
       process. Pause the current thread for T - t0 seconds, where T is some
       reasonable time.
43.    The libgcrypt library supports GCRY_KDF_SCRYPT.
44.    Weather feeds.
45.    Create a user's configuration database. Store key types too.
46.    C++11, unique_ptr and malloc().
47.    gcry_md_setkey() does not impose minimum key lengths.
48.    Counting remote accounts is possible.
49.    How do I trust an external process?
50.    Per-participant permissions.
51.    Allow custom addresses for spoton_external_address.
52.    An account system where the initiator provides both random arrays.
53.    Audible.
54.    Provide new digests to lessen public key usage.
55.    SMP accounts?
56.    Voice of Spot-On.
57.    Generate a 2048-bit prime, exchange it with a participant, and
       perform SMP via the new prime. What do the mathematical connotations
       show us? May require a generator too.
58.    Qt 5.5.x supports serial ports.
59.    Rosetta, support GPG keys (separate) and simple interface
       into GPG (separate).
60.    Export/import URLs.
61.    Large database values (BYTEA) will impede the user experience.
62.    Per Magical Hero, download specific Web pages on request.
       Pseudo-proxy.
63.    Per Schmidt, share StarBeams through Buzz.

66.    Per-neighbor override of required signature proofs during key sharing.
67.    Poptastic in the Wizard.
68.    Chat institutions.
69.    UDP multicast address sharing is flawed in Qt 4.x.
       (https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-33419)
70.    URLs statistics.

Remaining Items

1.     Automatic computations of rapid StarBeam digests may be incorrect.
       See spoton::slotPopulateStars().
2.     Open Library.
3.     Retrieve only the latest e-mails from IMAP/POP3.
4.     Temporary queues. Will avoid dropped packets.
5.     Which key types to export and import? A new selection dialog.
6.     Random sequences for random data (http://www.fq.math.ca/Scanned/23-2/dawson.pdf).
7.     Bind the recipient's identity into all hybrid encryption schemes.
       E-mail remains.
8.     The Poptastic pixmap does not respect a scaled-contents request.
9.     Own NTRU implementation.
10.    Store McEliece objects.
